# Bdad-Exames
Repository with solved exams of Bases de Dados (Curricular unit of Integrated Master in Informatics and Computer Engineering at @Feup, 2nd year) 

As the drives are not organized and the teacher doesnt give exams and resolutions to the students, this repository is a tool to help you studying to the exam.

Shout out to [Carolina Soares](https://github.com/mcarolinaSoares) who helped me to answer these questions!
